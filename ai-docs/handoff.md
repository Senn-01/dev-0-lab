last-session: added data-analyst skill with 4-phase workflow
rationale: |
  Data analysis needs structure, not just tools. The data-analyst skill implements
  CRISP-DM pre-ML phases with emphasis on WHY each step matters. Philosophy-first
  approach: every action explained before execution. Skill + thin command pattern
  keeps philosophy centralized while commands provide entry points.
changelog:
  - version: 0.6.0
    changes:
      - Added data-analyst skill (5th skill)
      - 4-phase workflow: understand → explore → clean → validate
      - Philosophy.md with core analyst principles (always read)
      - WHY-first pattern in every phase
      - Commands: /data-understand, /data-explore, /data-clean, /data-validate
      - 17 cookbook files covering techniques, checklists, code patterns
      - Outputs to ai-docs/data-{phase}-{project}.md

    changes:
      - Added /research command for deep external research
      - ULTRATHINK phase for strategy with backpropagation thinking
      - Specialized agents (Concept, Docs, Examples, Ecosystem)
      - Conditional approval gate (quick vs deep research)
      - Structured output with metadata and query tracking
      - Follow-up handling (append to same doc)
  - version: 0.4.3
    changes:
      - Added /mcp command for MCP tool reference
      - Documented Tavily parameters (include_answer, chunks_per_source, etc.)

# Handoff

## Now

v0.6.0 - Added **data-analyst skill** with 4-phase workflow (understand → explore → clean → validate). Philosophy-first: explains WHY before HOW. Based on CRISP-DM pre-ML phases.

## Decisions

- **WHY-first pattern** - Every phase explains principles before actions
- **Philosophy hub** - `cookbook/philosophy.md` read before any phase
- **Skill + thin commands** - Skill centralizes logic, commands are entry points
- **Outputs to ai-docs/** - `ai-docs/data-{phase}-{project}.md` format
- **Research before implementation** - /research produces understanding docs
- **Specialized agents** - Concept, Docs, Examples, Ecosystem researchers
- **ULTRATHINK for strategy** - Deep reasoning with backpropagation
- **Lowercase skill names** - Official spec: lowercase, numbers, hyphens only

## Gotchas

- Hooks require `chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh`
- osascript needs macOS notification permissions
- Skills auto-trigger, no `/command` needed
- MCP tools in allowed-tools: unconfirmed if supported
- Tavily advanced search = 2 credits (vs 1 for basic)
- /research outputs to `ai-docs/research-{topic-slug}.md`
- /data-* commands output to `ai-docs/data-{phase}-{project}.md`

## Next

- [ ] Test data-analyst skill on real dataset
- [ ] Add data-analyst to examples/repo-template/
- [ ] Test repo-template in fresh repo
- [ ] Add skill activation hook (P0 from retrospective)
- [ ] Consider global installation `~/.claude/skills/`
