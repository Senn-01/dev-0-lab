version: 0.7.0
updated: 2025-12-20
last-session: enhanced skill-creator with official Anthropic patterns
rationale: |
  Deep analysis revealed skill-creator had excellent philosophy (IndyDevDan methodology)
  but gaps in tactical guidance compared to official Anthropic docs. Added: description
  writing guidance (PRIMARY trigger mechanism), allowed-tools integration into workflow,
  debugging cookbook, and limitations section. These align with official patterns while
  preserving the coaching-first approach.

# Handoff

## Now

v0.7.0 - Enhanced **skill-creator** with official Anthropic patterns. Added description writing guidance (front-load 100 chars, action verbs), integrated allowed-tools into planning workflow, created 5-debug.md cookbook, added limitations section. All changes synced to repo-template.

## Decisions

- **Description is PRIMARY trigger** - Front-load first 100 chars, use action verbs
- **allowed-tools in planning** - Decide tool access level during Step 1 (Plan)
- **5-step skill workflow** - Plan → Structure → Implement → Verify → Debug
- **IDKW style** - Front-load info, no vague pronouns, structured formats
- **Structured > prose for INPUT** - Lists, tables, headings for LLM-readable docs
- **YAML frontmatter standard** - rationale, changelog (semver 0.1.0+), linked_files
- **WHY-first pattern** - Every phase explains principles before actions
- **Philosophy hub** - `cookbook/philosophy.md` read before any phase
- **Skill + thin commands** - Skill centralizes logic, commands are entry points
- **Outputs to ai-docs/** - `ai-docs/data-{phase}-{project}.md` format
- **Research before implementation** - /research produces understanding docs
- **Specialized agents** - Concept, Docs, Examples, Ecosystem researchers
- **ULTRATHINK for strategy** - Deep reasoning with backpropagation
- **Lowercase skill names** - Official spec: lowercase, numbers, hyphens only

## Gotchas

- Hooks require `chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh`
- osascript needs macOS notification permissions
- Skills auto-trigger, no `/command` needed
- MCP tools in allowed-tools: unconfirmed if supported
- Tavily advanced search = 2 credits (vs 1 for basic)
- /research outputs to `ai-docs/research-{topic-slug}.md`
- /data-* commands output to `ai-docs/data-{phase}-{project}.md`
- Skills cannot invoke other Skills (no skill chains)
- No persistent state between skill invocations
- Description length impacts activation accuracy

## Next

- [ ] Test data-analyst skill on real dataset
- [ ] Add data-analyst to examples/repo-template/
- [ ] Test repo-template in fresh repo
- [ ] Add skill activation hook (P0 from retrospective)
- [ ] Consider global installation `~/.claude/skills/`
