# Data Analyst Skill

> "A data analyst is not a number cruncher. A data analyst is a TRANSLATOR between the language of business and the language of data."

## Purpose

Guide users through the professional data analysis lifecycle with emphasis on **understanding WHY** each step matters, not just HOW to do it.

## Philosophy

**ALWAYS** read `cookbook/philosophy.md` before any phase. It contains principles that apply to ALL data work.

## Phases

This skill covers the pre-ML phases of CRISP-DM:

| Phase | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1. Business Understanding | `/data-understand` | Define the problem before touching data |
| 2. Data Understanding | `/data-explore` | Explore data to form hypotheses |
| 3. Data Preparation | `/data-clean` | Transform raw data to analysis-ready |
| 4. Quality Validation | `/data-validate` | Verify data meets quality standards |

## Workflow Routing

### Phase Detection

Determine which phase based on user request:

- **understand**: "business problem", "stakeholder", "requirements", "scope", "objectives"
- **explore**: "EDA", "explore", "analyze", "distribution", "correlation", "understand the data"
- **clean**: "clean", "missing", "outlier", "duplicate", "prepare", "transform"
- **validate**: "quality", "validate", "check", "verify", "threshold"

### Execution Pattern

For each phase:

1. **READ PHILOSOPHY FIRST**
   - Always: `cookbook/philosophy.md`

2. **READ WHY**
   - Read: `cookbook/{phase}/why.md`
   - Explain the principle BEFORE doing anything

3. **GATHER CONTEXT**
   - Ask what data/project we're working with
   - Check for previous phase outputs in `ai-docs/`

4. **EXECUTE WITH EXPLANATION**
   - Follow checklist from `cookbook/{phase}/checklist.md`
   - For each step: explain WHY, then do HOW
   - Use code patterns from `cookbook/{phase}/code.md`

5. **PRODUCE OUTPUT**
   - Write report to `ai-docs/data-{phase}-{project-slug}.md`
   - Include metadata, findings, and next steps

## Output Format

All phase outputs go to `ai-docs/` with this structure:

```markdown
---
phase: [understand|explore|clean|validate]
project: [project-name]
dataset: [dataset-name or path]
date: [ISO timestamp]
status: [complete|in-progress]
---

# Data [Phase]: [Project Name]

## Summary
[Key findings in 2-3 sentences]

## Process
[What was done, with rationale]

## Findings
[Detailed results]

## Next Steps
[What should happen next]

## Artifacts
[Any generated files, scripts, visualizations]
```

## State Management

Phases build on each other:

```
/data-understand → ai-docs/data-understand-{project}.md
        ↓
/data-explore reads previous, produces → ai-docs/data-explore-{project}.md
        ↓
/data-clean reads previous, produces → ai-docs/data-clean-{project}.md
        ↓
/data-validate reads previous, produces → ai-docs/data-validate-{project}.md
```

If previous phase output exists, READ IT before proceeding.

## Cookbook Reference

| Phase | Files |
|-------|-------|
| Always | `cookbook/philosophy.md` |
| Understand | `cookbook/understand/why.md`, `questions.md`, `checklist.md`, `template.md` |
| Explore | `cookbook/explore/why.md`, `techniques.md`, `checklist.md`, `code.md` |
| Clean | `cookbook/clean/why.md`, `pipeline.md`, `strategies.md`, `code.md` |
| Validate | `cookbook/validate/why.md`, `dimensions.md`, `thresholds.md`, `code.md` |

## Rules

1. **NEVER skip the WHY** - Before any action, explain the principle
2. **READ before WRITE** - Check for existing phase outputs
3. **ASK before ASSUME** - Clarify project/dataset before proceeding
4. **EXPLAIN as you GO** - Each step includes its rationale
5. **DOCUMENT everything** - All outputs to ai-docs/ with metadata
